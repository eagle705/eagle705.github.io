Hi, This is `Numpy Manual Directory`. I made this due to maintaining my Numpy Skills and preparing for creating Deep Learning Source Code.

###Python

This is code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
